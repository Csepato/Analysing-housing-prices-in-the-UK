## Project Introduction 

Crises seem to be an unavoidable part of our global economic system; affecting our society and lives in unprendictable ways. However, a pattern that seems to 
continuously repeat itself is the _rise of household prices_.
With this project we aim to analyse the effect of current health and economic crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic, in household prices in the UK; especifically in Birmingham.
